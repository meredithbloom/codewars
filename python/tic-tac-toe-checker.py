# Tic Tac Toe checker - 5kyu
# If we were to set up a Tic-Tac-Toe game, we would want to know whether the board's current state is solved, wouldn't we? Our goal is to create a function that will check that for us!

# Assume that the board comes in the form of a 3x3 array, where the value is 0 if a spot is empty, 1 if it is an "X", or 2 if it is an "O", like so:
'''
[[0, 0, 1],
 [0, 1, 2],
 [2, 1, 0]]
'''
# Function should return -1 if board is unfinished AND no one has won yet (if there are empty spaces), 1 if 'X' won, 2 if 'O' won, or 0 if it's a draw

def is_solved(board):
	pass
